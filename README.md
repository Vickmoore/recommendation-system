Overview of the Project
You want to build a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform that can suggest personalized products based on user behavior. A machine learning model is already created and it is saved as e_commerce.ipynb,
Folder Structure
To keep your project organized, you'll create a specific folder structure. Here’s how it will look:

recommendation_system/
│
├── model/ # Folder for storing model files
│ ├── recommendation_model.pkl # The saved machine learning model
│ └── user_item_matrix.pkl # User-item interaction matrix used for recommendations
│
├── app.py # The main Flask application file
│
├── fiverr.ipynb # The Jupyter Notebook with your machine learning code
│
├── requirements.txt # A list of Python libraries needed for the project

└── README.md # Documentation for the project

# Recommendation System for Personalized Products

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform. The system suggests relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase data, and similar customer preferences.

## API Endpoints

### `/recommend`

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** This endpoint provides product recommendations based on the user ID supplied in the request.

#### Request Format

- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "<USER_ID>"
  }
  ```
  Replace `<USER_ID>` with the actual ID of the user for whom recommendations are being requested.

#### Response Format

- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "recommended_products": ["product_1", "product_2", "product_3"]
  }
  ```
  The response contains an array of recommended product IDs.

## Model Usage

To use the saved model:

1. Ensure the `recommendation_model.pkl` and `user_item_matrix.pkl` files are in the `model/` directory.
2. The model can be loaded in your Python code using the following snippet:

   ```python
   import pickle

   with open('model/recommendation_model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
       model = pickle.load(model_file)

   with open('model/user_item_matrix.pkl', 'rb') as matrix_file:
       user_item_matrix = pickle.load(matrix_file)
   ```
